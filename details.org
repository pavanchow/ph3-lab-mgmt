* Introduction

  A Virtual Labs /Experiment/ is a systematic collection of learning
  resources for Engineering students to learn about a single topic in
  a subject.  Each experiment consists of some theory and reading
  material, interactive simulations and quizes or tests.  The
  authoring process may be different for each institute but the end
  result is a collection of web-pages that are published together as
  an /Experiment/.

  Each experiment is a part of of /Lab/.  A /Lab/ is a conceptually a
  collection of /Experiments/ related to a subject.  A /Lab/ is
  published as a collection of web-pages that provide an entry point
  for a user to learn about that subject.  The list of experiments
  included in a lab provides links to all the available experiments.

  Creating a publishable lab along with all it's experiments, is a
  process that involves a lot of manual effort that does not add any
  value to the lab itself.  *Labgen* is a command-line tool that helps
  in avoiding all the repeatative effort involved in creating a lab
  from individual experiments and other lab content.

  The following processes are supported by *labgen*:
  1. Generation of Lab pages.
  2. Deployment of Lab
  3. Build and Deployment of Experiments

  The automated build and deployment of experiments is supported only
  for experiments generated using the /Phase 3 experiment authoring
  process/ (link?) defined by IIT-B.
  

* Requirements
  
  1. *node 12.12.x*
     - Download link: [[https://nodejs.org/en/download/][node]]
     - recommended to install via [[https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm][nvm]]
  2. *npm 6.11.x*


* Setup

** Install Dependencies

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash

   npm install
   
   #+END_SRC

  
* Generating Lab Pages
  
  
** Create Lab Repository

   Create a new lab repository on [[https://github.com/virtual-labs][Github]] or clone and existing one.
   The repository should be empty.

** Initialize Lab Descriptor

   To start with the process of lab generation, you need a /Lab
   Descriptor/.

   /Lab Descriptor/ is a json file the contains data for lab pages and
   other information for lab and experiment deployment.  [[file:lab-descriptor.org][This]] document
   describes the structure of a lab descriptor file.

   Run the following command to initialize a lab descriptor file that
   contains all the required fields, without any values.  

   #+NAME: labgen-init
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     npm run labgen -- init <path/to/lab/repo>
   #+END_SRC

   In the above command =<path/to/lab/repo>= should be replaced with
   the actual path to the local lab repository mentioned in the first
   step.

*** Init Example

   For example, if https://github.com/virtual-labs/myNewLab is your
   repository and you clone it on your local system at location
   =/home/myuser/virtual-labs/=, then you would do run the following
   commands -

   #+NAME: labgen-init-example
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     npm run labgen -- init /home/myuser/virtual-labs/myNewLab
   #+END_SRC
   
   or 

   #+NAME: labgen-init-example-rel-path
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     npm run labgen -- init ~/virtual-labs/myNewLab
   #+END_SRC

   This will generate the file
   =~/virtual-labs/myNewLab/lab-descriptor.json=.
   
** Complete and Verify Lab Descriptor   

   Fill all the values in the =<path/to/lab/repo>/lab-descriptor.json=
   file generated above and create a pull-request to get the
   lab-descriptor approved.

   
*** LD Verification Example

    Continuing the [[Init Example][init]] example, lets see how to submit the completed
    lab-descriptor for verification.

    In the lab repository, switch to a new branch and edit the json.

    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    cd ~/virtual-labs/myNewLab
    git checkout -b lab-descriptor
    editor lab-descriptor.json
    #+END_SRC

    After filling the json push the file to remote and create a pull
    request.

    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      git add lab-descriptor.json
      git commit -m "lab-descriptor for verification"
      git push origin lab-descriptor
    #+END_SRC

    Once this pull request is merged to master, do not make any new
    changes to the lab-descriptor.


** Run All

   From the /Phase-3-Lab-Template/ repository, run the following.
   
   #+NAME: labgen-generate
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     npm run labgen -- <path/to/lab/repo>
   #+END_SRC

* Updates

** Reporting

   The timestamp, verion number and status (success or failure) of the
   run is updated to a google sheet.

** Release management of Lab Sources

   After a lab (including all its experiments) is deployed, a new tag
   is created for the lab using the master branch.  The tag number
   follows semantic versioning and the next version number is derived
   from the previous version with the help of input provided by the
   user regarding type of the release (major, minor or patch).  By
   default a minor version is generated.

   The lab descriptor is updated with the current release number.

** Automated JSON Validation

   The lab descriptor is validated using a [[file:labDescSchema.json][schema]].  If anything is
   invalid in the lab descriptor, the error is displayed and process
   aborts.

** Deployment Process

   1. Stage all experiments
   2. Stage Lab
   3. Deploy Experiments
   4. Deploy Lab

*** Staging

    - /var/www/html/
      - <lab-name>/
	- stage/
	  - all lab sources here.
	  - exp/
	    - all experiments here.
	- contents of the stage/ directory are copied here after
          staging is complete.

    If anything fails, you need to start the process again.
	
** TODO 

   - [-] move release type to pre run option.
   - [-] log to file
   - [X] remove lab name from path to experiment
     - experiment is unit of development
     - Current url pattern: https://de-iitr.vlabs.ac.in/digital-electronics-iitr/exp/truth-table-gates/
     - New url pattern: https://de-iitr.vlabs.ac.in/exp/truth-table-gates/
     - [X] +symlink for compatibility+
     - [X] test on a lab that is not linked
   - KT to Balamma
     - [-] session 1 scheduled on <2020-08-31 Mon>.  Find the [[file:KT.org][minutes]]
