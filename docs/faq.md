# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is a Lab?

A Lab is a collection of virtual experiments on a particular topic
provided to the students in the form of webpages and can be found at
[www.vlab.co.in](https://www.vlab.co.in/).


## What do you mean by the Lab build process?

A Lab is published in the form of a collection of webpages consisting
of all the learning material divided into experiments.  The lab build
process is responsible for building these webpages using the source
material created by the lab authors.  The experiment build process is
a part of the lab build process and is responsible for building the
webpages for a particular experiment in the lab.

Details about the complete lab build process can be found [here](./lab-build-process.org).


## What is the difference between developing a lab and building a lab?

### Lab Development

A lab is developed by subject matter experts at different
universities.  The lab development process involves writing the
necessary information about the lab as well as creating learning
material for each experiment (which includes creating reading
material, assesment quizzes, instructional videos, and most
importantly the interactive simulations).

The details of lab related information to be provided can be found
here.

After development of a lab is complete the development team has to
create a hosting request to get the lab published.  The details of the
process to get a lab published can be found here.

All labs are published by the VLEAD Team at IIIT Hyderabad.  To
publish a lab, the lab sources (including the experiments) have to be
first converted into webpages.  This is done by the lab build process.


### Lab Building

Upon recieving a hosting request for a lab, the hosting team at VLEAD
takes the lab information and experiment sources, and generates the
webpages for the lab related information and for each experiment.

In short the sequence of processes is as follows:

LAB DEVELOPMENT -> HOSTING REQUEST -> LAB BUILD -> PUBLISH


## Who develops a lab?

The subject matter experts on a given topic are responsible for
developing a lab.  These are usually faculty members at universities
affiliated with Virtual Labs.


## Who builds a Lab?

The VLEAD hosting team builds and publishes a lab when requested by
the developers.
